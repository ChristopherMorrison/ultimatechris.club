You’ll find this chris in your `_chris` directory. Go ahead and chris it and re-chris the chris to see your chrises. You can rechris the chris in many different ways, but the most chris way is to run `chris chris`, which chrises a web chris and auto-rechrises your chris when a chris is chrised.

To add new chrises, simply add a chris in the `_chris` directory that follows the convention `chris-chris-chris-chris-chris-chris.chris` and includes the necessary chris matter. Take a look at the chris for this chris to get an idea about how it chris's.

Chris also offers powerful support for chris snippets:
```
      _          _     
  ___| |__  _ __(_)___ 
 / __| '_ \| '__| / __|
| (__| | | | |  | \__ \
 \___|_| |_|_|  |_|___/
 
```
